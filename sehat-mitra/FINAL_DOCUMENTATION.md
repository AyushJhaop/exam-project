### Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Strategy

A CRM strategy for telemedicine focuses on managing the entire patient lifecycle to build lasting relationships and loyalty. The goal is to move a user from a simple prospect to a loyal patient who repeatedly uses the service.

- 
    
    **Acquisition & Lead Capture**: The journey begins when a potential patient signs up through a lead-capture form on the website or app. This initial data (name, email, basic health concerns) is stored in the CRM system, tagging them as a "**Prospect**".
    
- 
    
    **Qualification & Engagement**: The CRM uses a **priority queue** system to qualify leads based on the urgency of their stated symptoms. The system engages them by prompting them to complete their medical profile. Once completed, their status is updated to "**Qualified**," and they are ready to be converted.
    
- 
    
    **Conversion & Service**: A patient is converted to a "**Customer**" when they book their first appointment. The CRM manages all appointment details, sends reminders, and facilitates communication between the doctor and patient. The quality of this service experience is crucial.
    
- 
    
    **Retention & Loyalty**: After an appointment, the CRM triggers follow-up actions like sending feedback surveys to calculate metrics like the **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**. Based on their activity (e.g., booking multiple appointments), their status can be elevated to "**Loyal**". The system can then use **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** to send targeted promotions or health tips to retain these valuable patients.

### The 7Ps of Marketing Mix

This framework helps define the marketing strategy for the telemedicine service.

1. **Product**: The core product is the secure, on-demand virtual consultation with verified medical professionals. This includes features like the doctor-patient matching algorithm, appointment scheduling, and the operations dashboard for internal tracking.
2. **Price**: This refers to the pricing strategy. Models could include a flat fee per consultation, a subscription-based plan for families, or integration with insurance providers for direct billing. Pricing must reflect the expertise of the doctors and the convenience offered.
3. **Place**: The "place" is entirely digital. It's the website, mobile application, and any online portal where patients can access the service. The platform must be highly accessible, reliable, and easy to navigate.
4. **Promotion**: This involves all activities used to attract patients. Examples include digital advertising (Google, social media), content marketing (health blogs, wellness tips), partnerships with corporate wellness programs, and referral programs for existing users.
5. **People**: The "people" are a critical element of trust in healthcare. This includes not only the qualified and empathetic doctors but also the customer support staff who handle queries and the technical team ensuring the platform runs smoothly.
6. 
    
    **Process**: This is the end-to-end patient journey. It starts from signing up, moves to finding and booking a doctor, conducting the consultation, receiving a prescription or follow-up notes, and making a payment. A seamless and intuitive process is key to a positive user experience.
    
7. **Physical Evidence**: In a digital service, physical evidence refers to the tangible and intangible cues that build trust. This includes a professional and secure website, detailed doctor profiles with credentials and reviews, clear and transparent pricing, branded email communications, and an official digital receipt after payment.

### The Kano Model

The Kano Model helps classify features based on how they impact patient satisfaction. It's essential for prioritizing feature development.

- **Basic Attributes (Must-Haves)**: Patients expect these features. If they are missing, patients will be very dissatisfied, but their presence doesn't cause excitement.
    - Secure user login and authentication.
    - Ability to browse doctor profiles.
    - A functional appointment booking system.
    - Secure payment processing.
- **Performance Attributes (One-Dimensional)**: For these features, "more is better." The better they perform, the more satisfied patients are. These are often key areas of competition.
    - **Accuracy of the doctor matching algorithm**: A more relevant match leads to higher satisfaction.
    - **Short waiting times**: The faster a patient can see a doctor, the better.
    - **Video/audio quality**: High-definition, stable call quality directly impacts the consultation experience.
    - **Number of available specialists**: A wider variety of doctors increases the platform's utility.
- **Attractive Attributes (Delighters)**: These are unexpected, innovative features that create a "wow" factor and can become a major competitive advantage. Their absence causes no dissatisfaction because patients don't expect them.
    - An **AI-powered symptom checker** that suggests the right type of specialist to consult.
    - Integration with wearable devices (like Apple Watch or Fitbit) to share health data with the doctor automatically.
    - A feature to analyze referral networks to identify influential patients.
    - Instant digital prescription delivery to a partner pharmacy for immediate pickup.

## Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

| Item | Description | Estimated Cost (₹) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Servers / Cloud Setup | Initial setup of cloud servers (AWS/GCP/Azure) | 1,50,000 | One-time setup for database, backend, API |
| Development Hardware | Laptops, monitors for dev team | 2,00,000 | 2–3 laptops + peripherals |
| Software Licenses | IDEs, design tools (Figma, Adobe, VSCode paid plugins) | 50,000 | Annual license or one-time |
| Initial Security & Compliance | SSL, HIPAA/GDPR compliance tools | 75,000 | One-time setup for encryption, data security |
| Office Setup (Optional) | Furniture, networking, internet | 1,00,000 | If physical office is planned |
| **Total CapEx** | — | **5,75,000** | One-time investment |

## Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

| Item | Description | Monthly Cost (₹) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud Hosting / Database | AWS/GCP server instances, storage, backups | 25,000 | Scale as users grow |
| API Costs | Payment gateway, SMS/Email notifications, AI APIs | 15,000 | Usage-based |
| Staff Salaries | Developers, support, sales | 2,50,000 | Core team of 3–5 people |
| Maintenance & Updates | Bug fixes, feature updates | 20,000 | Could increase with growth |

## Notes:

1. **CapEx** is mostly front-loaded – buy once, use long-term.
2. **OpEx** scales with users – more patients, more API calls, more storage, higher costs.
3. For early-stage startups, **CapEx should be minimized** by using cloud services instead of physical servers.
4. **Opex optimization ideas:** caching, serverless functions, free-tier APIs during MVP.
