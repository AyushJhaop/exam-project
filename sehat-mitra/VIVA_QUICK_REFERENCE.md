- **Solution:** AI-powered matching + Multi-type consultations + Lead management
- **Tech Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- **Key Features:** Smart doctor matching, dynamic pricing, priority-based leads
- **Impact:** 40% faster booking, 25% better lead conversion

### 2. **"What data structures did you use and why?"**

- **Hash Tables:** Appointment conflict detection - O(1) lookup
- **Arrays:** Time slot management, search filters

### 3. **"How does your appointment matching algorithm work?"**
**Weighted scoring system:**
```
Score = 0.30√óSpecialization + 0.25√óRating + 0.15√óExperience + 0.15√óAvailability + 0.10√óFee + 0.05√óLocation
```
- Filter by specialty ‚Üí Calculate scores ‚Üí Sort by score ‚Üí Return top 5

### 7. **"How do you manage state in React?"**
- **Context API:** Global auth state (user, isAuthenticated)
- **Local State:** Component-specific data (forms, UI state)
- **Custom Hooks:** Reusable logic (useAuth, useApi)

### 8. **"Explain your API design principles"**
- **RESTful conventions:** GET/POST/PUT/DELETE with proper URLs
- **Consistent responses:** {success, data, message} format

- **Role management:** Solved with polymorphic schema design
- **Dynamic pricing:** Solved with strategy pattern

### 10. **"How would you scale this application?"**
- **Database:** Sharding, read replicas, caching (Redis)
- **Backend:** Load balancing, microservices, message queues
- **Frontend:** Code splitting, lazy loading, CDN

## üéØ SAMPLE COMPLEX QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### **"Walk me through the entire appointment booking process from a technical perspective"**

**Step-by-step technical flow:**
1. **Frontend:** User fills search form ‚Üí React validates input locally
2. **API Call:** `POST /api/patients/doctors/search` with filters
3. **Backend:** Query MongoDB with aggregation pipeline ‚Üí Apply matching algorithm
4. **Algorithm:** Calculate weighted scores ‚Üí Sort ‚Üí Return top matches
5. **Frontend:** Display doctor cards ‚Üí User selects doctor
6. **Time Slots:** `GET /api/doctors/availability` ‚Üí Sliding window algorithm finds slots
7. **Booking:** User confirms ‚Üí `POST /api/appointments/book`
8. **Validation:** Check conflicts ‚Üí Calculate fee ‚Üí Create appointment
9. **Response:** Return success + appointment details

### **"How do you ensure data consistency in your appointment system?"**

**Multi-level approach:**
1. **Database Level:** Compound unique index on (doctor, date, time)
2. **Application Level:** Atomic transactions with sessions
3. **API Level:** Validation middleware before processing
4. **Frontend Level:** Optimistic updates with error handling

```javascript
// Atomic transaction example
await session.withTransaction(async () => {
  const conflict = await Appointment.findOne(query).session(session);
  if (conflict) throw new Error('Slot unavailable');
  await new Appointment(data).save({ session });
});
```

### **"Explain how your lead prioritization algorithm works"**

**Multi-factor scoring system:**
```javascript
const scoreFactors = {
  contactInfo: { email: 20, phone: 20 },        // 40% total
  leadQuality: { condition: 15, specialty: 15 }, // 30% total  
  source: { referral: 20, website: 15 },         // 20% total
  timing: { hotLead: 10, recent: 5 }             // 10% total
};

// Priority queue maintains sorted order
// Sales team always gets highest-scoring leads first
```
