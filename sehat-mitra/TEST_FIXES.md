# Test Instructions for Fixed Issues

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Health Summary Total Spent** - Now correctly calculates and displays total amount spent on completed appointments
2. **Date/Time Display** - Fixed "Invalid date and time" issues in appointment history

## How to Test:

### 1. Login to Test Account
- **URL**: http://localhost:5174
- **Email**: `patient@test.com`
- **Password**: `patient123`

### 2. Test Health Summary (Issue #1)
Navigate to Patient Dashboard and verify the "Health Summary" section shows:
- ✅ **Total Spent: ₹1,250** (should no longer be ₹0)
- ✅ Total Consultations: 3
- ✅ Success Rate: 67%
- ✅ Loyalty Score: 3

### 3. Test Date/Time Display (Issue #2)
Navigate to "My Appointments" or "Appointment History" and verify:
- ✅ **Date displays properly**: e.g., "Oct 1, 2024" (not "Invalid date")
- ✅ **Time displays properly**: e.g., "10:00 AM" (not "Invalid time")
- ✅ **Status shows correctly**: "completed", "scheduled"
- ✅ **Symptoms display properly**: Arrays show as comma-separated text

### Expected Test Data:
You should see 3 test appointments:
1. **Oct 1, 2024 at 10:00 AM** - Status: completed - Fee: ₹500
2. **Oct 15, 2024 at 2:00 PM** - Status: completed - Fee: ₹750  
3. **Nov 1, 2024 at 4:00 PM** - Status: scheduled - Fee: ₹400

**Total for completed appointments: ₹500 + ₹750 = ₹1,250** ✅

## Technical Changes Made:

### Backend Changes:
- Fixed `statusBreakdown` field mapping in dashboard response
- Ensured proper calculation of `totalSpent` from completed appointments
- Verified appointment data structure includes correct date/time fields

### Frontend Changes:
- Added proper `formatDate()` and `formatTime()` functions to AppointmentHistory
- Fixed field mapping: `appointment.date` → `appointment.appointmentDate`
- Fixed field mapping: `appointment.time` → `appointment.startTime`  
- Added proper handling for symptoms arrays
- Fixed doctor name display from separate firstName/lastName fields
- Added utility functions for status colors and icons

All issues are now resolved and the application should work correctly!
